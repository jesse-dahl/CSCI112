This is a loan/mortgage calculator I created for my CSCI112 course.
The program asks the user for the initial loan amount, the loan term in months (AKA number of payments), and the interest rate per year. It then calculates and prints the final monthly payments you will have to make, as well as the total interest you will pay.
Every time you run the program a new text file will be generated showing columns of each payment you have to make, as well as the interest, principal, and principal balance for each payment
