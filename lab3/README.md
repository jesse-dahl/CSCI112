This program scans in a file of numbers and determines the amount of numbers within the list based on the first number within the list. It then iterates over the rest of the numbers in the list and outputs the smallest/largest numbers, average/range of the numbers, and the standard deviation of all the numbers in the list.

*This program implements functions, loops, selection/condition statements, arrays, pointer functions, and file redirection
